- 👋 Hi, I’m @LD1913 but people usually just call me Leila :)
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much everything. I love learning and am hoping to become a fluent computer expert so I can solve and automate everyday problems/tasks with the help of our computer friends :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Javascript. I also read lots of psychology books in my free time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any type of beginner projects to get some practical knowledge of the industry and improve myself as a programmer and overall the skills developed through this experience.
- 📫 I am available under the email: LD1913@gmail.com I'll do my best to respond as quick as possible :)

below are some project ideas I'd be interested in pursuing:

- Password Manager
- spam filter on an email program that immediately spams certain criteria
- building a website that lumps the data on a certain topic together (like a giant textbook) through the use of machine learning/AI
- Sudoku browser extention (kinda useless, I know but just for funsies)
